# Track Remote Appfilter

[![pre-commit.ci status](https://results.pre-commit.ci/badge/github/rdehenne/track-remote-appfilter/main.svg)](https://results.pre-commit.ci/latest/github/rdehenne/track-remote-appfilter/main)

A GitHub action to track changes from a remote `appfilter.xml` file and submit changes in a new PR on your repository.
This action is suitable for open source Android icon packs.

## Usage

The recommended way of using this action is through periodic jobs, so that you get notified when the remote `appfilter.xml` changes.

In `.github/workflows`, create a new workflow file, e.g. `action-remote-appfilter.yml`.
Below is a sample workflow file that tracks [Arcticons'](https://github.com/Arcticons-Team/Arcticons/) `appfilter.xml` file:

```
name: Update appfilter from Arcticons

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '37 15 * * *' # Triggers once a day at 3:37PM GMT, see https://crontab.guru/ for help

jobs:
  track-remote-appfilter:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Track Remote Appfilter
        uses: rdehenne/track-remote-appfilter@v0.0.1-alpha7
        with:
          local-appfilter: 'newicons/appfilter.xml'
          remote-appfilter: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arcticons-Team/Arcticons/refs/heads/main/newicons/appfilter.xml'
          commit-message: 'Add appfilter items from Arcticons'
          title: 'Add appfilter items from Arcticons'
          body: |
            This PR adds new appfilter items from Arcticons that could be matched to existing drawables.

            See Arcticons' [appfilter.xml](https://github.com/Arcticons-Team/Arcticons/blob/main/newicons/appfilter.xml) for more details.
```
